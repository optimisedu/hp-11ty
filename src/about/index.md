Optimise-U is an online portfolio of my work. I have been part of SEO, UX and UI communities for nearly a decade. This blog is about “practising best practices". Simply, Optimisation is the tradeoff between performance and accessibility.

My blog aims to demystify not just what is a best practice, but also how these practices might get you on top of Google’s ranking and improve your users’ experience. Well implemented optimisation both saves money and improves conversions. The internet isn’t free, every page-view costs data and electricity – 3.7% of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions come from the internet[(BBC)](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think), and in the next 3 years [20% of the global energy bill will come from the cloud(Guardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/).

In there are literally thousands of full-stack frameworks offering built in performance optimisation – making you a faster coder, and your websites’ more responsive for your users. Many platforms say that they are SEO friendly out the box, but if you don’t know what you are doing – and more importantly who you’re doing it for – you will run into bottlenecks.
